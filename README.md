Praatje-Plaatje (Prapla) is a speech- controlled learning application for young children that hardly speak Dutch. With Prapla, a child learns new words and phrases, and practices proper Dutch pronunciation using a combination of speech technology and images. The web-app works on any mobile phone, tablet or desktop.
