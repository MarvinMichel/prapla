Before you begin: have you checked the [code of conduct](https://github.com/MarvinMichel/prapla/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?

## Turning tasks to issues
Every week, we defide the tasks at hand to each group member. Each member splits it's tasks into smaller tasks. 
To get a grip of what everyone is doing, issues are automated to fill the [project's board](https://github.com/MarvinMichel/prapla/projects).
Every taks will get it's own issue. Can't find your issue? Open your own. 

## Branches & code review
For bigger tasks or combined tasks, create a seperate branch to work on. This way, we won't have conflicting changes.
After the tasks is done, you can create a pull request. Add at least two reviewers to it to give a code review.
If there are no conflicts or problems in the code, the reviewers can accept the pull request. After acceptance, merge the request to `main`.
